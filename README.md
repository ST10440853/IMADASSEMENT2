Introduction to mobile Application Development (5112) - Assignment 1 

 

introduction 

This assignment we were tasked to create a special mobile application for a family friend named Sarah. Sarah is an avid history buff and educator who wants to use technology to inspire young minds. she wants an app which compares users age to famous history figures.as she believes this app will make education exciting and fun for students. The mobile application will generate historical figures based on age entered and will include fun facts about the historical figure. 

 

The purpose of the application 

The purpose of the application Is to motivate and inspire the younger generation to technology. This will make them also enjoy the educational process which in turn will bust their knowledge about historical figures with an additional fun fact on the side. This application will make it more fun for the educator and the students as over time they will be able to tell the teacher what they are learning from the app making the educational process fun and exciting.  

As for the application users are supposed to input their input which is an age between 20-100 then the mobile application will run through its data base to find a historical figure suited for the age that has been selected and add a fun fact to go with the historical figure as an output. More importantly the application only has the age from 20 to 100.  

 

If the user writes the incorrect age an error will display which will tell the user what the mistake was and how to fix the mistake this will make the user write the correct age to see the correct output  is a famous historical figure with an interesting fun fact .the other error would include not entering an age on the place to write the age  or writing the age in decimals . This will tell the user to use the correct things when using the mobile application.   

 

Conclusion 

This App will help Sarah when it comes to teaching her students about historical figures as she is passionate about teaching the subject history. This will make an encouraging and joyful experience for her and her students. This assignment was to build her mobile web application which was filled with bright and playful colours for the student to have a fun and joy able mobile app with interesting dead historical figure between 20 to 100. 

 

 

Application design 

This mobile application was built for children. The app has bright and colorful colors which will lead to a more playful and enjoyable experience. This application is supposed to be joyful and vibrant as this is a children's app which makes everything more fun for children to like. The mobile application starts off with an image which was found on Adobe Express. This image expresses what the mobile application is about as the first thing you see is a large text which is history. The next thing you see is the input where you put the age of the user. It then flows into the next two buttons which are generated and clear. Generate produces the output which shows the famous historical figure and a fun fact about the historical figure. "Clear “is the second button and it clears everything in the input and output. The last thing at the bottom of the mobile application is the output which shows the historical figure and the fun fact about the Mobile application. This program prioritizes straightforwardness as it makes it easy use which makes it easy to use for the pupils   

 

 

Error handing 

The first error messages are if the user does not enter an age. The next error is when the user enters an invalid age less than 20 or more than 100 years. The mobile application will only work if the user puts in the correct age between 20 to 100 years of age. The third error is if the user does not put in a number. These errors will help the user use the app  

 

Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub actions  

  

For me to submit this assignment, I had to push it to GitHub. The following steps were taken:  

 Log in to your GitHub account and create a new repository.  

 Rename the repository to IMAD (Introduction to Mobile Application Development) ICE Task 2.  

 Open file explorer and open the folder that your Introduction to Mobile Application Development (IMAD) project is stored in.  

 Click on file explorer icon in that folder and type “cmd” (Command Prompt) and it will automatically take you to the command window where you will type the configuration steps given to you by GitHub.  

 After typing each configuration step, you must press the enter key   

  

After typing out each configuration step correctly and it is completed, you need to refresh the browser to see if your project has been pushed to GitHub.  

 In the Readme file you need to include the YouTube link of your screen recording video presentation. This presentation is a demonstration of how your app works, the design and the code.  

 You need to include the documentation in the Readme file before submitting.  

  

Copy the Readme link to Brightspace to submit the ICE Task. 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

User Interface Screenshot  

This screen shot is displaying the user interface and how the app would look on a phone. This screenshot highlights the layout which displays the image view, text view, edit text and some buttons. This is a light brown which is a vibrant color as it is astatically pleasing to a young pupil.    

 

 

Screenshots of the code of the APP 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The screenshot show the source code of an Android application written in Kotlin, specifically the MainActivity class. This is what is being shown 

The MainActivity class extends AppCompatActivity(), which is a base class for activities in Android. 

Two private variables are declared: etPersonAge of type EditText (a user input field) and tvDisplayAnswer of type TextView (for displaying text). 

The onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) method is overridden, which is the entry point for the activity. 

Inside onCreate(), various UI elements are being retrieved by their respective IDs using findViewById(). 

The etPersonAge and tvDisplayAnswer views are being retrieved and assigned to the corresponding variables. 

Two buttons are being retrieved: btnGenerateHistory (presumably to trigger some logic) and btnClearScreen (to clear the screen). 

Click listeners are being set on these buttons using setOnClickListener to respond to user interactions. 

The generateHistory() function is being called when the btnGenerateHistory is clicked. 

 

Screenshot of app running  

 

 

 

This is a screenshot of the app running doing what the app is supposed to do the input is age36 and the output was Marlyin Monroe and a fun fact about him. As you can see the users which are the children will get helped in known history and be inspired to do technology  

 

 

Inconclusion  

This app is straightforwardand will help children know more about history and how fun technology can be as Sarah wants these children to  inspired
